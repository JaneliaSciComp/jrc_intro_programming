    "Some applications of vectorization are not as obvious as the examples above. In the next example, we want to scan a single stranded DNA string of length n consisting of the nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'T' and 'G' to look for segments of fixed length k where A and T are most over-represented. We can do this by simply counting the number of 'A' and 'T' is shifting windows of size k. The naive version counts A and T for a window, then shifts the window by 1 position and repeats in a loop. The fast version uses k-1 shifted views of a numpy array and sums over the k views (including unshifted). Since k is usually much smaller than n, this is much more efficient than the naive version. We compare the times taken to the built-in numpy function `convolve` - the naive version is 40x slower than convolve for our example, while the vectorized version is just under 2x slower.\n",

    "### Example - Using vectorizaiton to speed up 1D cellular automata simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will simulate a 1D cellular automata. In particular, we will simulate the 18 rules shown in the first figure at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html. For the 1D CA, we need to calculate the next state of a cell given its own state and the states of its left and right neighbors. The rule to update is given by the 8-bit binary representation of an integer. For exampe, rule 30 is '00011110', where each binary digit represnts the next state for the state matching that bit position, where position 0 = 0, position 1 =  1, position 2 = 1, and so on. The binary representation of 0 in 3 bits is 000 so that means that if my current state is 0 and both my neighbors are also 0, my next state will be 0. Position 4 in 3 bits is 100 and position 4 has value 1, so that means that if my current state is 0, my left neighbor is 0 and my right neighbor is 1, then my next state will be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to code this is to use a loop to check 3 consecutive cells, then move to the next cell and repeat, but this is very slow if the grid is large. Instead, we will use numpy indexing to shift rows one position to the left and one position to the right. If we now look across these 3 rows (one unshirted and 2 shifted), each column of 3 provides the currrent state of 3 neighboring cells. Now the next trick is to add these up as if the values came from the $2^2$ (left), $2^1$ (unshifted) and $2^0$ positions. Finally, we take these values (which will range from 0 to 7) and use the given rule to map to a new state vector using logical indexing. Using this vectorizaiation, we only ever add 3 (possibly very long) vectors at each step. Going over the code below carefully should make this explanaiton clearer."
