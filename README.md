# Syllabus
## Classes 1 and 2
Session 1 introduces the command line interface, including navigating directory structures, manipulating files, editing text files, using filter commands, stringing together filters using pipes and redirection, and possibly making simple bash scripts.
Session 2 is an introduction to basic programming concepts in python, including data types/structures, conditional expressions, loops, and functions.

## Classes 3 and 4
Sessions 3 and 4 are a little more flexible.  We will write a few complete programs in python, learn how to use the version control program `git` to manage work in progress, and try out a few commonly used python libraries for data analysis.  If there's a specific topic you'd like to cover, let me know in an email or in person.
