<h3>Checkpoint:</h3>

<p>Open your command line.  In Windows, you will be using Git Bash, which I asked you to install before class.  In OS X, you will be using the built-in program Terminal, or the downloaded program iTerm2.  What does the prompt look like?</p>

<p>At the prompt, type <code>echo $0</code> and press enter.  <code>echo</code> is a program that prints information to the screen, and <code>$0</code> is a variable representing the shell with which you are interacting, so the command should tell us which shell you are running.  For OS X, you should see something like <code>/bin/bash</code>, and for Windows with Git Bash you should see something ending with <code>/sh.exe</code>.</p>

<p>Let's download some files so that we can all navigate the same environment:
  - Type <code>git https://github.com/williamrowell/jrc_intro_programming.git</code> and press enter.
  - If you get any error messages, ask for help.</p>
