### Checkpoint:
Open your command line.  In Windows, you will be using Git Bash, which I asked you to install before class.  In OS X, you will be using the built-in program Terminal, or the downloaded program iTerm2.  What does the prompt look like?

At the prompt, type `echo $0` and press enter.  `echo` is a program that prints information to the screen, and `$0` is a variable representing the shell with which you are interacting, so the command should tell us which shell you are running.  For OS X, you should see something like `/bin/bash`, and for Windows with Git Bash you should see something ending with `/sh.exe`.

Let's download some files so that we can all navigate the same environment:
  - Type `git https://github.com/williamrowell/jrc_intro_programming.git` and press enter.
  - If you get any error messages, ask for help.
